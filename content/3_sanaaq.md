Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk was born in 1931 in an Inuit community in Nunavik, Canada. When she was young, her father was often ill, and so the traditionally male duty of hunting and providing for the family fell on her. When she married her husband, she lived a more traditionally female life, taking care of her family and house. Local missionaries took note of her deep knowledge, of both sides of Inuit life, and asked her to assist in language education. "She initially assisted Father Lucien Schneider, O.M.I., in producing his Inuit/French dictionary. She then worked with Father Robert Lechat, O.M.I., who wanted to improve his proficiency in the native language. He provided lined notebooks and asked her to write down sentences, in syllabics, that contained as many terms as possible from daily life. She started writing in her igloo or tent, while the children slept or when free from household chores. But this task grew wearisome. Letting her imagination roam, she created characters and described their fortunes and misfortunes over the different seasons. In short, she recounted the life of a small group of semi-nomadic Inuit families just before the first (Europeans) became established in the region. At twenty-two years of age, Mitiarjuk reinvented the novel, even though she had never read one." [1]

Written over the course of 20 years (for reasons I will explain later) and spanning 48 chapters and 200 pages, Sanaaq is a cultural and literary treasure. Following a young woman named Sanaaq, her family, and her community, the novel details their daily life, subsisting in the Arctic and adapting to change and loss. Several important themes in Inuit history, surrounding the arrival of white people, manifest themselves in this book, through the writing of a woman who experienced them. It is considered the first ever Inuit novel.

It is difficult to track the history of early contact between Europeans and Inuit. The Canadian Arctic is a massive area of land and sea, and some areas were explored by Europeans before others. For example, there were Dutch whalers present in Davis Strait, between Greenland and Baffin Island, all the way back in the 1700s [2], while some communities, like the fictional community Mitiarjuk wrote about, went well into the 1900’s without ever seeing a white man (though they had heard of them, and even acquired some firearms and tea through trade with other Inuit). The following is a passage from Sanaaq that details their communities first interaction with white people.

While they slept, at daybreak, a very large boat arrived. Arnatuinnaq was taken aback when she left the tent that morning. It was the first time she had ever seen such a thing. She shouted to her kinfolk, “Ilakka! Wake up! What’s this thing standing still in front of us?”

Just as her last words trailed off, the ship made a loud booming sound and, coming nearer and nearer, made several more. The strange sight filled everyone with fear, and they made frenzied efforts to hide behind tent covers. Some, like Arnatuinnaq and Quamaq, even began to cry. Finally, a large outboard full of Qallunaat headed to shore. These beings were clearly human, and the camp’s inhabitants, though still surprised, were no longer afraid. The Qallunaat had come to visit. [3]

While European traders were certainly agents of change, and their presence has a place in the novel, Sanaaq is not a story purely about the ways that white people changed the lives of the characters. In fact, most of Sanaaq is about the opposite; hunting, gathering, migration, and everyday occurrences of traditional life are the subject of most chapters. That being said, European influence did change the way people subsisted, since now they had access to hunting rifles. The following passages are about the daily life of Sanaaq’s community.

{% capture text %}
A woman, Sanaaq, was getting ready to go and gather branches for mat-making. This is what she did. Before leaving, she assembled a tumpline to carry the load, her ulu to cut the shrubs, and a glove to yank them out of the ground. She also filled a small bag with provisions: tea, meatm and blubber, as well as her pipe, matches, and chewing tobacco.

Sanaaq set off across a wide plain and then through a long stretch of foothills. She kept walking further and further from home, followed by her two dogs, Kajualuk and Qirniq. On the way she saw some aqiggiit and prepared to kill them with a few well-aimed stones. But the dogs ran after the birds. Sanaaq tried her best to stop the dogs, yelling at the top of her voice, “Hau! Hau! Kajualuk hau! hau!”

Her shouting was to no avail and the dogs continued to give chase. The ptarmigans flew off. Very much annoyed, she continued on her way and came to the end of her journey.

…

She began the long trip home, foraging for anything edible on the way, although it was now twilight. The route was uphill and so tiring that it was often necessary to stop for rest. Several times she found some wild berries. She picked them as a gift for her daughter, who was minding their home, and dropped them into the improvised teapot. The little girl was waiting at home and was increasingly in Sanaaq’s thoughts as home drew nearer. Sanaaq was almost there but the two dogs were the first to arrive. She trailed behind, within eyesight.

Her daughter saw her and shouted, “It’s Mother! It’s Mother!”

The little girl ran out so eagerly that she fell several times, even hitting her face on a rock. Finally the two were together. The mother cuddled her little girl – no wonder, she had just hit her face on a rock – and offered the small berries she had picked for her. She then gave her a kuni, murmuring a mmm… of affection and taking her by the hand. Arriving outside their home and exhausted, Sanaaq put her burden down and crawled in headfirst, pushing the bundle in front of her. [4]

Another passage describes the return of a hunting trip on the water.

{% capture text %}
Qalingu had returned from hunting in his qajaq. His sister-in-law, Arnatuinnaq, and his stepdaughter, Qumaq, came to meet him by the shore. His load was a very heavy one: an utjuk and also two natsiik that he had killed. Arnatuinnaq hauled the qajaq out of the water by pulling on its usuujaq. She was dragging it by the bow to dry land. 

Seeing her pull it all by herself, Qalingu spoke up. “Hold on! It’s really loaded... I’ll get out first. I’ve just killed an ujjuk! I had to chase it a long time before I finally caught it. It came up for air. I fired and shot it. It was wounded so I had to keep chasing and whenever it broke the surface I shouted ‘ua! ua!’ while firing my rifle. ikkuu! That made it dive. I paddled ahead as fast as I could while it was still under water. And when it reappeared at the surface, I kept on yelling and trying to make it dive again right away. After a while it was running out of breath and coming to the surface more often. I got closer and closer. I fired and finally shot it again when it was just alongside. It almost sank, but its back rose to the surface twice and I rushed ahead to grab it before it could sink.” 

Qalingu had finished his story. The two began to carry part of the animal away, each taking a chunk of meat they had carved off. Their folks, Sanaaq and Aqiarulaaq, came to help. When all four were together, Sanaaq said, “Qatannguuk ai! Once we’re done carrying all of this away, we'll have a feast with the kujapiit of the utjuk." [5]

Another inevitable part of living in harsh Arctic conditions is hardship, and Sanaaq’s community faced no shortage. In an emotional chapter we see tragedy strike on a hunting trip.

{% capture text %}
Just then Jiimialuk again saw a puiji in a small stretch of open water. He whistled at it several times, and suddenly the seal headed toward him, coming very close. Jiimialuk grabbed his rifle, aimed, and fired. ikkuu! He killed it. Being quite far from his companion, he started thinking, “Aa! My stomach is just aching... As soon as the animal gets to the edge of the ice, I’ll eat it, for my stomach is really growling. I’m hungry for seal meat.”

He began shouting and waving to his faraway companion. “Come quick! I’ve killed a seal. It’s floating!”
Qalingu came hurrying over. When he arrived, he said, “I never did get the one I wounded! You really ought to be thanked for killing one that floats... But it doesn’t look like it’s coming to the edge... 

I’ll steer an ice cake over there and fetch it!”

“But it does look like it’s getting closer,” replied Jiimialuk. 

“Ai! Never mind, ai! We’ll try to catch it by tossing a weighted line.” 

“It’s floated to the edge! I’ll get it,” said Jiimialuk.

The animal had indeed come closer but was stuck against a few small pieces of floating ice, and Jiimialuk was unable to grab hold. He nonetheless tried to reach it by stretching his arm further and further. Then he cried out, “Ii! I’m falling in!”

Trying to grab his prey, Jiimialuk had fallen into the sea. Qalingu rushed over. He saw a Jiimialuk’s head poke out of the water, then disappear and, despite his efforts to look under the ice, saw nothing more... His companion had been swept under the ice by a strong current and was gone... Yet Jiimialuk’s seal was still afloat. Qalingu caught it. The one who had killed it had drowned, the very man who had said he would eat the seal…

Qalingu was now all alone on the ice, with night falling and his companion dead. He had to go home and Jiimialuk’s seal had to be dragged there. To do this, he tied a leather strap to one of its rear flippers as well as to its lower jaw, by means of a slipknot. He set off, obsessed by the memory of his drowned companion. He was very unhappy thinking about the man’s kinfolk, whom he would have to tell the news. The prospect filled him with some apprehension. He thought, “I’ll soon arrive alone... Our companions still think that Jiimialuk is out hunting... They’ll be very unhappy about Aqiarulaaq’s only son dying while still young... He was saying not long ago he was going to eat, not thinking that death was close at hand... He had no idea he was going to die…”

Qalingu stood still a long moment, as if in a daze, thinking, “And what about me, when will I die? I have no idea! And Jiimialuk, where has he gone? If he’s gone to kappianartuvik, it’d be because death had taken him unexpectedly, but if he’s been sent to quvianartuvik, he’ll already be very happy... And what about me, what will become of me? I too will die like him, even though it doesn’t seem like I’ll be dying soon... Death may take me by surprise the same way...” [6]

The writing of Sanaaq was temporarily halted, after Mitiarjuk had to go to the hospital to be treated for tuberculosis. She stopped writing halfway through chapter 24 of the novel. On her return, she wrote chapters 25 through 37, leaving chapter 24 temporarily unfinished. Just like Mitiarjuk, Sanaaq is also hospitalized.  

{% capture text %}
“As soon as you’re cured,” she was told, “you’ll go home. Don’t bother yourself about having to be taken away!”

She nonetheless longed for her family. Whenever Inuit, either men or women, are sent to hospital for treatment, they are always very anxious to return home. They fervently wish to return to their loved ones. They miss the country food and suffer from staying in an overheated place. Sanaaq, after being in pain for a long time, now noticed a daily improvement in her health. She and the other Inuit were happy, for they were being well taken care of. Yet they dearly wanted to go home. They preferred their country, where there was no overheating. Sanaaq was thankful to the nurses and the hospital, her pains having gone. But she could not forget her son. She thought continually about him, from the moment she got up to the moment she went to bed. [7]

If you have read the previous section on traditional stories, you might have noticed that a few aspects of traditional life are seemingly missing, namely the presence of an angakok and the observance of taboos. There is also no mention of polygyny or spouse-exchange. You could assume that the presence of Christian missionaries completely got rid of these traditions, but there was sometimes trepidation in conversion. [8] Even in communities with a Christian presence in the early 1900’s, like in the Pangnirtung region, they still followed taboos and participated in a shamanistic festival called The Feast of Sedna, which was held in honor of the sea goddess, and featured spouse-exchange, two things the missionaries considered sinful. [9] Some Inuit resisted conversion, citing conflicts with existing beliefs [10], but in Sanaaq, the character’s resistance to conversion seems to be more apprehension about what others in the community will think about them.

Arnatuinnaq wished to follow the Catholic faith, but had not yet said so. “I want to join their faith,” she often thought to herself.

In truth, she still had to talk it over with her family… She was afraid, though, of being prevented from doing so by Sanaaq, her older sister, and by Qalingu. She was scared that her family would give her a hard time. The thought made her very ill at ease

“Never mind ai! Since I’m afraid of no longer being well treated, it’s not possible for me now...”

Meanwhile Qumaq was thinking, “It’d be better if I followed the iksigarjuaq, even if I have to face the opposition of my kinfolk. It doesn’t matter... Can’t be helped... As for my body, it will die, and then where will I go? What does my body matter!”

She was eager. Aanikallak shared the same ideas, but she felt helpless because her mother forbade her from following the iksigarjuaq. Qumaq, whose mother was still making some effort to hold her back, stuck to her choice. Aanikallak too persevered, despite strong opposition

Arnatuinnaq, Qumaq, and Aanikallak all wished to convert. Qumaq was very keen. Arnatuinnaq was afraid and self-conscious. She made obstacles out of anything for herself. As soon as someone talked to her, she immediately began to have doubts, just as Maatiusi did. Qumaq was very happy and said, “I’m going to follow this faith because I think about it continually!”

She strove to push herself whenever she felt like lazing around. She developed a habit of working fervently and, though she had other occupations, began to pray more. Anything became a motive for her to think about her family. She had found a way to be happy now. [11]

The more likely explanation for the lack of taboo observance and traditional Inuit religion in Sanaaq is found in the context and purpose of the book. If you recall, Sanaaq was originally meant as a phrase book, and it was written under supervision of Christian missionaries. An excerpt by Bernard Saladin d’Anglure, the anthropologist who worked with Mitiarjuk directly, written in the foreword of Sanaaq, explains this “self censorship.”

"… slight variations are noticeable in the content of the episodes, depending on whether they were written for the missionaries or for the anthropologist. Some self-censorship by the author may be detected in the first two manuscripts collected by the Oblates…" "Mitarjuk was a practicing Catholic and in these episodes, through the utterances of Sanaaq, her heroine, expresses moralizing judgments on the old beliefs, such as omens." [12]

But that isn’t the case for the entire novel. "The second part of episode 24, interrupted by the author’s hospitalization and completed later for the anthropologist, clearly shows a change in attitude, with a long development on mythology and beliefs. Furthermore, the last ten episodes address themes at are absent from the initial manuscripts…" [13]

In chapter 24, the community finds, among a group of beluga whales, a lumaartalik, also known as a narwhal. Taqriasuk, an elder, recalls the legend of Lumaajuq. Like the stories in the previous section, this is a version of a well known traditional story.

{% capture text %}
“A very long time ago, a blind boy killed a polar bear with an arrow. But he was tricked by his mother, who led him to believe that he had accidentally killed their dog, Uugaq. They indeed had a dog by that name. The mother had a daughter a little younger than the boy. The mother went with her daughter to cook the bear meat a bit further away, while the blind boy stayed home, although he was the one who had killed the bear. They were gone the whole day. While the blind boy was at home, he heard birds flying north in their migration and he called out to them, ‘Give me back my sight!’ The mother and daughter had boiled the bear meat, and the daughter pretended to eat some, but in fact she tucked some pieces for her brother into her jacket by sliding them down her neck. She then headed home and gave him the meat, telling him it was from their dog Uugaq, for she was afraid of their mother, who was claiming that he had killed their dog Uugaq. Thanks to his sister, the blind son did not die of hunger, though knowing full well that he had killed a polar bear. When he again heard the cry of the migrating birds flying overhead, he once more called out, ‘Give me back my sight!’ Then and there some loons visited him. They led him to a small lake, to give him his sight back. The loons plunged the blind boy underwater after telling him to move his body the moment he began to choke, to let them know. Just when he was about to drown, they brought him back to the surface to breathe. He could now make out a lemming’s burrow off in the distance, atop a small hill… The loons plunged him a second time underwater, until he again began to choke, this being indicated by a movement of his body. They brought him back to the surface. Because his sight had improved, they let him go home by himself. On the way back, he came to the level land where the polar bear’s skin was staked to the ground. He ripped it to pieces so that it could no longer be used. His mother realized that he was not blind anymore and went to meet him… When summer arrived and they were all alone in their camp, the mother asked her son how the people at the neighbouring camp hunted belugas. The son answered that a hunter would catch them with the help of his mother, whom he would attach to the end of his harpoon line… The son’s mother, who envied the other camp’s hunting success, insisted that she be attached to the end of her son’s harpoon line when they went beluga hunting. He had successfully convinced her, falsely, that she would be needed to help him capture his prey. Despite her ill will towards her son, she told him, ‘That one! That one! That little grey calf! Harpoon it!’ But he harpooned the largest of the belugas, an all-white beluga. Because she was attached to the harpoon line by her waist, she was dragged over the shoreline rocks and out to sea as if she were a float...” [14]

The change in attitude that d’Anglure wrote about comes after, when Qalingu thanks Taqriasuk for providing him with knowledge about which kinds of water game are edible, and the story of Lumaajuq. 

{% capture text %}
“Thank you! I won’t forget any of what you’ve told me and which I didn’t know before. I need to be taught. Those who aren’t elders are less knowledgeable than those who are. Without elders the Inuit are nothing, for there is much knowledge that the elders alone possess!” 

“My knowledge comes not from me but from my ancestors. It seems to be mine but, in fact, it comes to me from people who preceded me. I pass it on to all of you, to all of your descendants and all of your kinfolk!” [15]

As the novel progresses, white involvement with the community increases. A prominent force in the region in the 1900’s was the Hudson’s Bay Company. They would build trading posts in Inuit communities, trading European goods like biscuits, candy, and rope to Inuit in exchange for furs and other animal products. They would also often ask the Inuit families to move around to maximize area coverage, or take men on whaling voyages. [16] In Sanaaq, Qalingu is approached by traders to assist them in hunting. 

{% capture text %}
The same day, in late afternoon, a plane appeared.

“Listen to that drone. Sounds like a plane!” said Qalingu. “Over there! It’s arriving… There are two men aboard!”

It was a single-engine airplane. The Inuit were very nervous and the children were crying. Everyone went to greet them. When the door to the airplane opened, little Qalliutuq was very afraid.

The two Qallunaak spoke the Inuit language. Their chief asked Qalingu, “Who are you?”

“I’m Qalingu!”

“Do you want to come and work among the Qallunaat?”

“No! I’ve never been away from here. I don’t know the language of the Qallunaat.”

“If you accept, you’ll be treated very well. You’ll start off receiving two hundred dollars a month and your family will get a house. The plane will be back in a week.”

“OK,” said Qalingu, who decided to help his family. “I’d like to give it a try.” Speaking to Sanaaq, he added, “I’ll be away working for two months. You’ll be given assistance.”

She agreed.

Qalingu made his preparations. He was afraid he would not be allowed to come back. Airplane travel scared him, this being his first time... and the plane was very fast. His family—Qumaq, Sanaaq, and Qalliutuq—broke into tears at the thought that he might never come back... When the airplane disappeared in the clouds, they went home very sad because Qalingu was gone.

One of the boldest things that Mitiarjuk wrote about after the return from her second hospital trip, was conjugal violence, and how it effects the victim and the entire community. Since we don’t have statistics dating back to the 1930-40s, it’s unclear if this was common, or if it’s based off Mitiarjuk’s personal experience. In the novel, Sanaaq’s son is in need of medical attention, and the only way to a hospital is to send him, alone, with the Europeans. Her husband, Qalingu, wants her to send the child to a hospital, but Sanaaq is afraid she won’t see her son again, so she runs away.

{% capture text %}
Sanaaq woke up very early the next morning. She rubbed her eyes and began to prepare to escape with her son. She dressed carefully in order not to wake the others. She did everything very slowly, so as not to interrupt their slumber. She dressed without making a noise, and they all remained sound asleep... She took hold of her sleeping son and placed him in the back pouch of her coat. He certainly was able to walk, but, out of affection for him, she was unwilling to make him walk so soon after awaking.

…

Back in the tent, meanwhile, Qalingu and Arnatuinnaq had woken up. Qalingu said to his sister-in-law, “Your older sister has run away. She’s gone!”
“Ii autualuk!” said Arnatuinnaq. “I wonder where she could have gone! Let’s both go looking for her, Qalingu! Aikuluk!”

…

Meanwhile, Sanaaq was beginning to think of going home, for her son was crying from hunger.
“I love my dear son so much,” she thought, “and I’m making him suffer... At home, there’s lots to eat while here there’s nothing... If I love my son, how can I make him suffer from hunger and prevent him from going away and getting proper care? I must go home. I’ve acted with no regard for common sense. If they want to take him away, I should accept it, even though it makes me unhappy... I know it’s for his own good... I must accept it, if I truly love him!”
And Sanaaq headed home. Her folks were still looking for her.

…

Sanaaq left to go looking for Qalingu. Both were now in search of each other. As he looked, Qalingu began to think, “My wife may be dead… Maybe a wild animal has killed her... Anyway, she must be dying of hunger...”

Meanwhile Sanaaq was telling herself, “My husband must be tired... Had I not run away, he wouldn’t be in such a condition... I’ll go home only when I’ve found him!”

Qalingu was accompanied by his dogs, whereas Sanaaq was alone. Qalingu’s dogs had smelled something and had located Sanaaq, but without her son. Qalingu too spotted her and was now thinking, “My son is surely dead! I’ll make Sanaaq pay for causing my son’s death!”

When he caught up to Sanaaq, he questioned her. “Where’s my son? Is he dead?”

Sanaaq kept silent. Because she said nothing, he asked again, “Where is he? Is he dead?”

He began to hit Sanaaq. He beat her with his fists while heaping insults on her. “Ivvilualuk! You’re completely out of your mind! You’ve been furious ever since you found out that my son had to go away!”

“My son’s at home!” shot back Sanaaq. “I left to go looking for you because I love you, and now that you’ve found me you accuse me of all kinds of evil things! My son is fine. Arnatuinnaq is taking care of him. If I wasn’t fit for you, why did you marry me? I love you and that’s why I went looking for you, and here you are beating and hurting me!” [18]

They return together, but Sanaaq is unable to work, due to her intense pain, and must go to the hospital.

In a sharp contrast to the rest of the novel, the last few chapters take on a supernatural element, in a way they wouldn’t have when Mitiarjuk was supervised by missionaries. Maatiusi, had just found out that his fiancé, Arnatuinnaq, had a child with one of the Europeans. 

{% capture text %}
Maatiusi was out walking alone in late summer. He was feeling down. All kinds of thoughts were turning over and over in his mind, even bad ones. He had been warned, in keeping with Inuit customs, that it was not good to dwell too much on something, but he ignored these warnings and let his despondency run free. He became used to mulling over his thoughts, in which Arnatuinnaq was first and foremost. He found her very desirable, thought much about her and, suddenly, while walking, caught sight of someone who looked like her. He believed it was Arnatuinnaq. Maatiusi saw a woman with the edge of her hood folded back and he really thought it was Arnatuinnaq. Being alone, he took her as a companion and talked and made love with her. He felt euphoric...

…

Maatiusi was unaware that he had changed, but those close to him, his camp mates, could see he was not doing well at all, even though they did not know why. His way of life was not the same as before. He seldom talked anymore, had become closed-minded, and avoided the company of other Inuit while still eating and working with them. He sometimes went hunting but no longer took care of his clothes. He dressed shabbily. Sometimes, his behaviour puzzled his camp mates. They would hear him talking aloud while alone and even making eyes at someone. At times, it looked as if someone was calling him. At other times, he would suddenly take off without warning. At still other times, it looked as if he was fainting... All this was the effect of his nuliarsaq, who was making love to him... People noticed too
that his skin was damp. Those who lived with him found that Maatiusi often had a very foul odour...

…

Qalingu asked Maatiusi, “Are you sick?”

“No, I’m not sick!”

“What’s wrong with you? You’re living a life that’s not like the one you lived before!”

“Not at all. I haven’t changed!”

Clearly, he was not going to say anything. Qalingu no longer enjoyed him as a hunting companion and began to think, “Maatiusi must be possessed by a nuliarsaq because sometimes he converses with nobody and he smells very bad.” [19]

A nuliarsaq is similar to a succubus. Maatiusi gets rid of the being by talking with his community members.

{% capture text %}
“I thought I’d have Arnatuinnaq as my wife. Then, while walking far away, when I was sad because of her, I saw it for the first time... The edge of its hood was turned back and… it forbade me to talk. If I did, it said it would cut my head off with a knife... Yet I still felt attached to it. That’s why I took so long to talk!”

“Maatiusi! From now on you’ll be truly happy and you’ll never see it again. It said it’d kill you just to keep you from talking...”

As soon as he had talked, Maatiusi truly felt much better. He had rid himself of his nuliarsaq thanks to his travelling companion and for this he was really happy. From then on he would no longer have such torments. As for the others, who had still been fishing, they decided to head home with the start of a heavy downpour... [20]
