**You can also find a variety of different types of sources**, from popular to scholarly, in a variety of different formats in [the U of I library catalog](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. In the search box, type in your keyword search terms. For instance, if your topic is **Low-fat vs. whole milk consumption**, you can use *"Low-fat" AND "whole milk" AND consumption* as your keyword search terms. You may consider adding other keywords, such as effect\*, impact\*, etc.

In the dropdown menu next to the magnifying glass icon in the search box, choose UI Library+E-Resources if you are **only interested in resources that can be found in the U of I Library**. Otherwise, choose UI+Summit+E-Resources to access resources in [37 academic libraries throughout Oregon, Washington and Idaho](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/services/ill/summit.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, keeping in mind that the delivery of these physical items from this network usually takes between a week and two weeks.

### Refine Results 

You will find many of the same filters to refine results in our catalog as we discussed in EBSCO Premier, including **Full Text Online**, if you only want materials you can read in it's entirety remotely, **Resource Type** to view peer reviewed or non-peer reviewed material, **a publication date slider** to filter chronologically and **Subject Filter** which uses the Library of Congress Subject Heading schema, which you can learn more about [here](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html).

**If you are looking for Full Text Online results**, you may be sent to many of the different online periodicals that we subscribe to as a library. You will need to be logged in as a student and then look for **View Online**, where you will be sent to the online journal. Though presentation may vary depending on the site, look for the **red and white PDF icon** that should send you to the download page.
