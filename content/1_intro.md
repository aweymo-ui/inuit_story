Last year I read a book called "In the Empire of Ice", where an environmental researcher traveled the Arctic, and spoke to various Indigenous groups about how climate change was effecting them. She lived with Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Russia, and Greenland. By far my favorite part was when her hosts would tell her traditional stories. When I started looking for more of those stories, I also found a long legacy of Inuit storytelling, which included movies and novels. My other favorite part of the book was when the author told the history of the places she stayed at. I found it interesting, and sometimes depressing, to see how Inuit life changed with the rest of the world.

This project was originally meant to cover more than one book, but as I was approaching the end, I realized that it was a better use of my time to focus intently on only one. The novel that I chose to focus on is Sanaaq, and I chose it because I felt it had the most interesting connections with history.

This website combines both my love of history and my love of storytelling, seeing how the events and shifts of 1900's Arctic Canada are manifested in the writing of Sanaaq. The first page is an introduction to Inuit culture for the unfamiliar, explained with the help of traditional stories, and the next two pages are focused on the first and second half of the novel Sanaaq.

#### A Note on Traditional Stories, Storytelling, and Language
The traditional stories that I include in the next page are the earliest that the compiler of the collection I used, Neil Christopher, could find. Many date back to the 1800's. While I'm glad that these stories were recorded, so that they were not lost, I feel obligated to explain that they were recorded by European explorers and anthropologists. It's entirely possible that they are shortened, or certain crude elements were ommitted, or that there were translation errors (many were translated from Inuktitut to French, and then again to English), or that there was regional cultural context that is now completely lost to us. There could also have been elements that were purposefully ommitted by the Inuit who told them. 

These stories, told orally, were in constant change across time, community, and individual storyteller. The stories that we have today, are just snapshots of these stories at a particular time and place. I recognize that Inuit storytelling could also mean more than just oral or written stories. Physical mediums, like carving (the author of Sanaaq was also a carver) tatoos, or sculpture, can also tell stories, but that is outside the scope of my project, which is focused only on oral and written stories.

Many do not know that the word "Eskimo" is offensive, and that the proper word is Inuit. For this project, that word has only been used in citations and direct quotes. Many also don't know that Inuit is a plural word, with Inuit person, or Inuk, being the singular. "Inuits" is not a word.
