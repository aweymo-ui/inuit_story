<div class="my-4">

<p>Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk was born in 1931 in an Inuit community in Nunavik, Canada. When she was young, her father was often ill, and so the traditionally male duty of hunting and providing for the family fell on her. When she married her husband, she lived a more traditionally female life, taking care of her family and house. Local missionaries took note of her deep knowledge, of both sides of Inuit life, and asked her to assist in language education. “She initially assisted Father Lucien Schneider, O.M.I., in producing his Inuit/French dictionary. She then worked with Father Robert Lechat, O.M.I., who wanted to improve his proficiency in the native language. He provided lined notebooks and asked her to write down sentences, in syllabics, that contained as many terms as possible from daily life. She started writing in her igloo or tent, while the children slept or when free from household chores. But this task grew wearisome. Letting her imagination roam, she created characters and described their fortunes and misfortunes over the different seasons. In short, she recounted the life of a small group of semi-nomadic Inuit families just before the first (Europeans) became established in the region. At twenty-two years of age, Mitiarjuk reinvented the novel, even though she had never read one.” [1]</p>

<p>Written over the course of 20 years (for reasons I will explain later) and spanning 48 chapters and 200 pages, Sanaaq is a cultural and literary treasure. Following a young woman named Sanaaq, her family, and her community, the novel details their daily life, subsisting in the Arctic and adapting to change and loss. Several important themes in Inuit history, surrounding the arrival of white people, manifest themselves in this book, through the writing of a woman who experienced them. It is considered the first ever Inuit novel.</p>

<p>It is difficult to track the history of early contact between Europeans and Inuit. The Canadian Arctic is a massive area of land and sea, and some areas were explored by Europeans before others. For example, there were Dutch whalers present in Davis Strait, between Greenland and Baffin Island, all the way back in the 1700s [2], while some communities, like the fictional community Mitiarjuk wrote about, went well into the 1900’s without ever seeing a white man (though they had heard of them, and even acquired some firearms and tea through trade with other Inuit). The following is a passage from Sanaaq that details their communities first interaction with white people.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>While they slept, at daybreak, a very large boat arrived. Arnatuinnaq was taken aback when she left the tent that morning. It was the first time she had ever seen such a thing. She shouted to her kinfolk, “Ilakka! Wake up! What’s this thing standing still in front of us?”</p>

<p>Just as her last words trailed off, the ship made a loud booming sound and, coming nearer and nearer, made several more. The strange sight filled everyone with fear, and they made frenzied efforts to hide behind tent covers. Some, like Arnatuinnaq and Quamaq, even began to cry. Finally, a large outboard full of Qallunaat headed to shore. These beings were clearly human, and the camp’s inhabitants, though still surprised, were no longer afraid. The Qallunaat had come to visit. [3]

<p>While European traders were certainly agents of change, and their presence has a place in the novel, Sanaaq is not a story purely about the ways that white people changed the lives of the characters. In fact, most of Sanaaq is about the opposite; hunting, gathering, migration, and everyday occurrences of traditional life are the subject of most chapters. The following passages are about the daily life of Sanaaq’s community.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>A woman, Sanaaq, was getting ready to go and gather branches for mat-making. This is what she did. Before leaving, she assembled a tumpline to carry the load, her ulu to cut the shrubs, and a glove to yank them out of the ground. She also filled a small bag with provisions: tea, meatm and blubber, as well as her pipe, matches, and chewing tobacco.</p>

<p>Sanaaq set off across a wide plain and then through a long stretch of foothills. She kept walking further and further from home, followed by her two dogs, Kajualuk and Qirniq. On the way she saw some aqiggiit and prepared to kill them with a few well-aimed stones. But the dogs ran after the birds. Sanaaq tried her best to stop the dogs, yelling at the top of her voice, “Hau! Hau! Kajualuk hau! hau!”</p>

<p>Her shouting was to no avail and the dogs continued to give chase. The ptarmigans flew off. Very much annoyed, she continued on her way and came to the end of her journey.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>She began the long trip home, foraging for anything edible on the way, although it was now twilight. The route was uphill and so tiring that it was often necessary to stop for rest. Several times she found some wild berries. She picked them as a gift for her daughter, who was minding their home, and dropped them into the improvised teapot. The little girl was waiting at home and was increasingly in Sanaaq’s thoughts as home drew nearer. Sanaaq was almost there but the two dogs were the first to arrive. She trailed behind, within eyesight.</p>

<p>Her daughter saw her and shouted, “It’s Mother! It’s Mother!”</p>

<p>The little girl ran out so eagerly that she fell several times, even hitting her face on a rock. Finally the two were together. The mother cuddled her little girl – no wonder, she had just hit her face on a rock – and offered the small berries she had picked for her. She then gave her a kuni, murmuring a mmm… of affection and taking her by the hand. Arriving outside their home and exhausted, Sanaaq put her burden down and crawled in headfirst, pushing the bundle in front of her. [4]

<p>Another passage describes the return of a hunting trip on the water. Chronologically, this passage takes place before the community meets the Qallunaat, and yet Qalingu has a rifle. Even without direct contact with Europeans, their goods, especially useful tools, made their way around communities quickly through trade. It’s likely that Qalingu got this through trade with another camp who had already met the Qallunaat. On his travels around the arctic, Knud Rasmussen finds among Inuit peoples with very limited contact with Qallunaat, all sorts of European goods, even finding gramaphones. [5]</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>Qalingu had returned from hunting in his qajaq. His sister-in-law, Arnatuinnaq, and his stepdaughter, Qumaq, came to meet him by the shore. His load was a very heavy one: an utjuk and also two natsiik that he had killed. Arnatuinnaq hauled the qajaq out of the water by pulling on its usuujaq. She was dragging it by the bow to dry land.</p>

<p>Seeing her pull it all by herself, Qalingu spoke up. “Hold on! It’s really loaded… I’ll get out first. I’ve just killed an ujjuk! I had to chase it a long time before I finally caught it. It came up for air. I fired and shot it. It was wounded so I had to keep chasing and whenever it broke the surface I shouted ‘ua! ua!’ while firing my rifle. ikkuu! That made it dive. I paddled ahead as fast as I could while it was still under water. And when it reappeared at the surface, I kept on yelling and trying to make it dive again right away. After a while it was running out of breath and coming to the surface more often. I got closer and closer. I fired and finally shot it again when it was just alongside. It almost sank, but its back rose to the surface twice and I rushed ahead to grab it before it could sink.”</p>

<p>Qalingu had finished his story. The two began to carry part of the animal away, each taking a chunk of meat they had carved off. Their folks, Sanaaq and Aqiarulaaq, came to help. When all four were together, Sanaaq said, “Qatannguuk ai! Once we’re done carrying all of this away, we’ll have a feast with the kujapiit of the utjuk.” [6]

<p>Another inevitable part of living in harsh Arctic conditions is hardship, and Sanaaq’s community faced no shortage. In an emotional chapter we see tragedy strike on a hunting trip.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>Just then Jiimialuk again saw a puiji in a small stretch of open water. He whistled at it several times, and suddenly the seal headed toward him, coming very close. Jiimialuk grabbed his rifle, aimed, and fired. ikkuu! He killed it. Being quite far from his companion, he started thinking, “Aa! My stomach is just aching… As soon as the animal gets to the edge of the ice, I’ll eat it, for my stomach is really growling. I’m hungry for seal meat.”</p>

<p>He began shouting and waving to his faraway companion. “Come quick! I’ve killed a seal. It’s floating!”
Qalingu came hurrying over. When he arrived, he said, “I never did get the one I wounded! You really ought to be thanked for killing one that floats… But it doesn’t look like it’s coming to the edge…</p>

<p>I’ll steer an ice cake over there and fetch it!”</p>

<p>“But it does look like it’s getting closer,” replied Jiimialuk.</p>

<p>“Ai! Never mind, ai! We’ll try to catch it by tossing a weighted line.”</p>

<p>“It’s floated to the edge! I’ll get it,” said Jiimialuk.</p>

<p>The animal had indeed come closer but was stuck against a few small pieces of floating ice, and Jiimialuk was unable to grab hold. He nonetheless tried to reach it by stretching his arm further and further. Then he cried out, “Ii! I’m falling in!”</p>

<p>Trying to grab his prey, Jiimialuk had fallen into the sea. Qalingu rushed over. He saw a Jiimialuk’s head poke out of the water, then disappear and, despite his efforts to look under the ice, saw nothing more… His companion had been swept under the ice by a strong current and was gone… Yet Jiimialuk’s seal was still afloat. Qalingu caught it. The one who had killed it had drowned, the very man who had said he would eat the seal…</p>

<p>Qalingu was now all alone on the ice, with night falling and his companion dead. He had to go home and Jiimialuk’s seal had to be dragged there. To do this, he tied a leather strap to one of its rear flippers as well as to its lower jaw, by means of a slipknot. He set off, obsessed by the memory of his drowned companion. He was very unhappy thinking about the man’s kinfolk, whom he would have to tell the news. The prospect filled him with some apprehension. He thought, “I’ll soon arrive alone… Our companions still think that Jiimialuk is out hunting… They’ll be very unhappy about Aqiarulaaq’s only son dying while still young… He was saying not long ago he was going to eat, not thinking that death was close at hand… He had no idea he was going to die…”</p>

<p>Qalingu stood still a long moment, as if in a daze, thinking, “And what about me, when will I die? I have no idea! And Jiimialuk, where has he gone? If he’s gone to kappianartuvik, it’d be because death had taken him unexpectedly, but if he’s been sent to quvianartuvik, he’ll already be very happy… And what about me, what will become of me? I too will die like him, even though it doesn’t seem like I’ll be dying soon… Death may take me by surprise the same way…” [7]

</div>

<p>The writing of Sanaaq was temporarily halted, after Mitiarjuk had to go to the hospital to be treated for tuberculosis. The Inuit had ethnomedical systems to deal with sickness and injury [8], but as a disease from the Qallunaat, they could do little against tuberculosis. Traders and missionaries built small hospitals in some communities, but other times the sick needed to be transported elsewhere. [9] She stopped writing halfway through chapter 24 of the novel. On her return from the hospital, she wrote chapters 25 through 37, leaving chapter 24 temporarily unfinished.  Just like Mitiarjuk, Sanaaq is also hospitalized. In this passage, we can see the two sides of the arctic hospitalization experience, the benefits and the mental toll it can take being away from your family. While most of the novel is written in the third person, Mitiarjuk seems to briefly speak directly to the reader.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>“As soon as you’re cured,” she was told, “you’ll go home. Don’t bother yourself about having to be taken away!”</p>

<p>She nonetheless longed for her family. Whenever Inuit, either men or women, are sent to hospital for treatment, they are always very anxious to return home. They fervently wish to return to their loved ones. They miss the country food and suffer from staying in an overheated place. Sanaaq, after being in pain for a long time, now noticed a daily improvement in her health. She and the other Inuit were happy, for they were being well taken care of. Yet they dearly wanted to go home. They preferred their country, where there was no overheating. Sanaaq was thankful to the nurses and the hospital, her pains having gone. But she could not forget her son. She thought continually about him, from the moment she got up to the moment she went to bed. [10]</p>
