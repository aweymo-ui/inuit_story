<div class="my-4">

<p>If you have read the previous section on traditional stories, you might have noticed that a few aspects of traditional life are seemingly missing, namely the presence of an angakok (and other supernatural elements) and the observance of taboos. There is also no mention of polygyny or spouse-exchange. You could assume that the presence of Christian missionaries completely got rid of these traditions, but there was sometimes trepidation in conversion. [1] Even in communities with missionary presence in the early 1900’s, for example the Pangnirtung region, still followed taboos and shamanistic traditions. In Pangnirtung they participated in a festival called The Feast of Sedna, which was held in honor of the sea goddess, and featured spouse-exchange, two things the missionaries considered sinful. [2] Some Inuit resisted conversion, citing conflicts with existing beliefs [3], but in Sanaaq, the characters’ resistance to conversion seems to be more apprehension about what others in the community will think of them. Being Catholic herself, Mitiarjuk writes positively about Christianity in this passage.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>Arnatuinnaq wished to follow the Catholic faith, but had not yet said so. “I want to join their faith,” she often thought to herself.</p>

<p>In truth, she still had to talk it over with her family… She was afraid, though, of being prevented from doing so by Sanaaq, her older sister, and by Qalingu. She was scared that her family would give her a hard time. The thought made her very ill at ease</p>

<p>“Never mind ai! Since I’m afraid of no longer being well treated, it’s not possible for me now…”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Qumaq was thinking, “It’d be better if I followed the iksigarjuaq, even if I have to face the opposition of my kinfolk. It doesn’t matter… Can’t be helped… As for my body, it will die, and then where will I go? What does my body matter!”</p>

<p>She was eager. Aanikallak shared the same ideas, but she felt helpless because her mother forbade her from following the iksigarjuaq. Qumaq, whose mother was still making some effort to hold her back, stuck to her choice. Aanikallak too persevered, despite strong opposition</p>

<p>Arnatuinnaq, Qumaq, and Aanikallak all wished to convert. Qumaq was very keen. Arnatuinnaq was afraid and self-conscious. She made obstacles out of anything for herself. As soon as someone talked to her, she immediately began to have doubts, just as Maatiusi did. Qumaq was very happy and said, “I’m going to follow this faith because I think about it continually!”</p>

<p>She strove to push herself whenever she felt like lazing around. She developed a habit of working fervently and, though she had other occupations, began to pray more. Anything became a motive for her to think about her family. She had found a way to be happy now. [4]

</div>

<p>The more likely explanation for the lack of taboo observance and traditional Inuit religion in Sanaaq is found in the context and purpose of the book. If you recall, Sanaaq was originally meant as a phrase book, and it was written under supervision of Christian missionaries. An excerpt by Bernard Saladin d’Anglure, the anthropologist who worked with Mitiarjuk directly, written in the foreword of Sanaaq, explains this “self censorship.”</p>

<p>“… slight variations are noticeable in the content of the episodes, depending on whether they were written for the missionaries or for the anthropologist. Some self-censorship by the author may be detected in the first two manuscripts collected by the Oblates…” “Mitarjuk was a practicing Catholic and in these episodes, through the utterances of Sanaaq, her heroine, expresses moralizing judgments on the old beliefs, such as omens.” [5]</p>

<p>But that isn’t the case for the entire novel. “The second part of episode 24, interrupted by the author’s hospitalization and completed later for the anthropologist, clearly shows a change in attitude, with a long development on mythology and beliefs. Furthermore, the last ten episodes address themes at are absent from the initial manuscripts…” [6]</p>

<p>In chapter 24, the community finds, among a group of beluga whales, a lumaartalik, also known as a narwhal. Taqriasuk, an elder, recalls the legend of Lumaajuq. Like the stories in the previous section, this is a version of a well known traditional story.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>“A very long time ago, a blind boy killed a polar bear with an arrow. But he was tricked by his mother, who led him to believe that he had accidentally killed their dog, Uugaq. They indeed had a dog by that name. The mother had a daughter a little younger than the boy. The mother went with her daughter to cook the bear meat a bit further away, while the blind boy stayed home, although he was the one who had killed the bear. They were gone the whole day. While the blind boy was at home, he heard birds flying north in their migration and he called out to them, ‘Give me back my sight!’ The mother and daughter had boiled the bear meat, and the daughter pretended to eat some, but in fact she tucked some pieces for her brother into her jacket by sliding them down her neck. She then headed home and gave him the meat, telling him it was from their dog Uugaq, for she was afraid of their mother, who was claiming that he had killed their dog Uugaq. Thanks to his sister, the blind son did not die of hunger, though knowing full well that he had killed a polar bear. When he again heard the cry of the migrating birds flying overhead, he once more called out, ‘Give me back my sight!’ Then and there some loons visited him. They led him to a small lake, to give him his sight back. The loons plunged the blind boy underwater after telling him to move his body the moment he began to choke, to let them know. Just when he was about to drown, they brought him back to the surface to breathe. He could now make out a lemming’s burrow off in the distance, atop a small hill… The loons plunged him a second time underwater, until he again began to choke, this being indicated by a movement of his body. They brought him back to the surface. Because his sight had improved, they let him go home by himself. On the way back, he came to the level land where the polar bear’s skin was staked to the ground. He ripped it to pieces so that it could no longer be used. His mother realized that he was not blind anymore and went to meet him… When summer arrived and they were all alone in their camp, the mother asked her son how the people at the neighbouring camp hunted belugas. The son answered that a hunter would catch them with the help of his mother, whom he would attach to the end of his harpoon line… The son’s mother, who envied the other camp’s hunting success, insisted that she be attached to the end of her son’s harpoon line when they went beluga hunting. He had successfully convinced her, falsely, that she would be needed to help him capture his prey. Despite her ill will towards her son, she told him, ‘That one! That one! That little grey calf! Harpoon it!’ But he harpooned the largest of the belugas, an all-white beluga. Because she was attached to the harpoon line by her waist, she was dragged over the shoreline rocks and out to sea as if she were a float…” [7]</p>

</div>

<p>The change in attitude that d’Anglure wrote about comes after, when Qalingu thanks Taqriasuk for providing him with knowledge about which kinds of water game are edible, and the story of Lumaajuq.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>“Thank you! I won’t forget any of what you’ve told me and which I didn’t know before. I need to be taught. Those who aren’t elders are less knowledgeable than those who are. Without elders the Inuit are nothing, for there is much knowledge that the elders alone possess!”</p>

<p>“My knowledge comes not from me but from my ancestors. It seems to be mine but, in fact, it comes to me from people who preceded me. I pass it on to all of you, to all of your descendants and all of your kinfolk!” [8]</p>

</div>

<p>As the novel progresses, white involvement with the community increases. A prominent force in the region in the 1900’s was the Hudson’s Bay Company. They would build trading posts in Inuit communities, trading European goods like biscuits, candy, and rope to Inuit in exchange for furs and other animal products. They would also often ask the Inuit families to move around to maximize area coverage, or take men on whaling voyages. [9] In Sanaaq, Qalingu is approached by traders to assist them in hunting.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>The same day, in late afternoon, a plane appeared.</p>

<p>“Listen to that drone. Sounds like a plane!” said Qalingu. “Over there! It’s arriving… There are two men aboard!”</p>

<p>It was a single-engine airplane. The Inuit were very nervous and the children were crying. Everyone went to greet them. When the door to the airplane opened, little Qalliutuq was very afraid.</p>

<p>The two Qallunaak spoke the Inuit language. Their chief asked Qalingu, “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m Qalingu!”</p>

<p>“Do you want to come and work among the Qallunaat?”</p>

<p>“No! I’ve never been away from here. I don’t know the language of the Qallunaat.”</p>

<p>“If you accept, you’ll be treated very well. You’ll start off receiving two hundred dollars a month and your family will get a house. The plane will be back in a week.”</p>

<p>“OK,” said Qalingu, who decided to help his family. “I’d like to give it a try.” Speaking to Sanaaq, he added, “I’ll be away working for two months. You’ll be given assistance.”</p>

<p>She agreed.</p>

<p>Qalingu made his preparations. He was afraid he would not be allowed to come back. Airplane travel scared him, this being his first time… and the plane was very fast. His family—Qumaq, Sanaaq, and Qalliutuq—broke into tears at the thought that he might never come back… When the airplane disappeared in the clouds, they went home very sad because Qalingu was gone. [10]

</div>

<p>One of the boldest things that Mitiarjuk wrote about after the return from her second hospital trip, was conjugal violence, and how it effects the victim and the entire community. Since we don’t have statistics dating back to the 1930-40s, it’s unclear if this was common, or if it’s based off Mitiarjuk’s personal experience. While living in Nunavut in 1971 (many years after Mitiarjuk finished writing Sanaaq), she encoutered conjugal violence, usually fueled by alcohol, in many of the families that she lived with. [11] In the novel, Sanaaq’s son is in need of medical attention, and the only way to a hospital is to send him, alone, with the Europeans. Her husband, Qalingu, wants her to send the child to a hospital, but Sanaaq is afraid she won’t see her son again, so she runs away.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>Sanaaq woke up very early the next morning. She rubbed her eyes and began to prepare to escape with her son. She dressed carefully in order not to wake the others. She did everything very slowly, so as not to interrupt their slumber. She dressed without making a noise, and they all remained sound asleep… She took hold of her sleeping son and placed him in the back pouch of her coat. He certainly was able to walk, but, out of affection for him, she was unwilling to make him walk so soon after awaking.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Back in the tent, meanwhile, Qalingu and Arnatuinnaq had woken up. Qalingu said to his sister-in-law, “Your older sister has run away. She’s gone!”
“Ii autualuk!” said Arnatuinnaq. “I wonder where she could have gone! Let’s both go looking for her, Qalingu! Aikuluk!”</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sanaaq was beginning to think of going home, for her son was crying from hunger.
“I love my dear son so much,” she thought, “and I’m making him suffer… At home, there’s lots to eat while here there’s nothing… If I love my son, how can I make him suffer from hunger and prevent him from going away and getting proper care? I must go home. I’ve acted with no regard for common sense. If they want to take him away, I should accept it, even though it makes me unhappy… I know it’s for his own good… I must accept it, if I truly love him!”
And Sanaaq headed home. Her folks were still looking for her.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Sanaaq left to go looking for Qalingu. Both were now in search of each other. As he looked, Qalingu began to think, “My wife may be dead… Maybe a wild animal has killed her… Anyway, she must be dying of hunger…”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sanaaq was telling herself, “My husband must be tired… Had I not run away, he wouldn’t be in such a condition… I’ll go home only when I’ve found him!”</p>

<p>Qalingu was accompanied by his dogs, whereas Sanaaq was alone. Qalingu’s dogs had smelled something and had located Sanaaq, but without her son. Qalingu too spotted her and was now thinking, “My son is surely dead! I’ll make Sanaaq pay for causing my son’s death!”</p>

<p>When he caught up to Sanaaq, he questioned her. “Where’s my son? Is he dead?”</p>

<p>Sanaaq kept silent. Because she said nothing, he asked again, “Where is he? Is he dead?”</p>

<p>He began to hit Sanaaq. He beat her with his fists while heaping insults on her. “Ivvilualuk! You’re completely out of your mind! You’ve been furious ever since you found out that my son had to go away!”</p>

<p>“My son’s at home!” shot back Sanaaq. “I left to go looking for you because I love you, and now that you’ve found me you accuse me of all kinds of evil things! My son is fine. Arnatuinnaq is taking care of him. If I wasn’t fit for you, why did you marry me? I love you and that’s why I went looking for you, and here you are beating and hurting me!” [12]</p>

</div>

<p>They return together, but Sanaaq is unable to work, due to her intense pain, and must go to the hospital.</p>

<p>In a sharp contrast to the rest of the novel, the last few chapters take on a supernatural element, in a way they wouldn’t have when Mitiarjuk was supervised by missionaries. Maatiusi, had just found out that his fiancé, Arnatuinnaq, had a child with one of the Europeans.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>Maatiusi was out walking alone in late summer. He was feeling down. All kinds of thoughts were turning over and over in his mind, even bad ones. He had been warned, in keeping with Inuit customs, that it was not good to dwell too much on something, but he ignored these warnings and let his despondency run free. He became used to mulling over his thoughts, in which Arnatuinnaq was first and foremost. He found her very desirable, thought much about her and, suddenly, while walking, caught sight of someone who looked like her. He believed it was Arnatuinnaq. Maatiusi saw a woman with the edge of her hood folded back and he really thought it was Arnatuinnaq. Being alone, he took her as a companion and talked and made love with her. He felt euphoric…</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Maatiusi was unaware that he had changed, but those close to him, his camp mates, could see he was not doing well at all, even though they did not know why. His way of life was not the same as before. He seldom talked anymore, had become closed-minded, and avoided the company of other Inuit while still eating and working with them. He sometimes went hunting but no longer took care of his clothes. He dressed shabbily. Sometimes, his behaviour puzzled his camp mates. They would hear him talking aloud while alone and even making eyes at someone. At times, it looked as if someone was calling him. At other times, he would suddenly take off without warning. At still other times, it looked as if he was fainting… All this was the effect of his nuliarsaq, who was making love to him… People noticed too
that his skin was damp. Those who lived with him found that Maatiusi often had a very foul odour…</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Qalingu asked Maatiusi, “Are you sick?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not sick!”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with you? You’re living a life that’s not like the one you lived before!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I haven’t changed!”</p>

<p>Clearly, he was not going to say anything. Qalingu no longer enjoyed him as a hunting companion and began to think, “Maatiusi must be possessed by a nuliarsaq because sometimes he converses with nobody and he smells very bad.” [13]
<br /><br /></p>
<h6 id="-nuliarsaq---invisible-female-lover-succubus">* Nuliarsaq - invisible female lover, succubus</h6>

</div>

<p>A nuliarsaq is similar to a succubus. Maatiusi gets rid of the being by talking with his community members.</p>

<div class="alert feature-alert alert-light " role="alert">

<p>“I thought I’d have Arnatuinnaq as my wife. Then, while walking far away, when I was sad because of her, I saw it for the first time… The edge of its hood was turned back and… it forbade me to talk. If I did, it said it would cut my head off with a knife… Yet I still felt attached to it. That’s why I took so long to talk!”</p>

<p>“Maatiusi! From now on you’ll be truly happy and you’ll never see it again. It said it’d kill you just to keep you from talking…”</p>

<p>As soon as he had talked, Maatiusi truly felt much better. He had rid himself of his nuliarsaq thanks to his travelling companion and for this he was really happy. From then on he would no longer have such torments. As for the others, who had still been fishing, they decided to head home with the start of a heavy downpour… [14]</p>

</div>

<p>The novel ends there.</p>

<p>Mitiarjuk Napaaluk went on to write more books, to serve as teaching tools for school children. Copies of Sanaaq can be found in classrooms across Arctic Canada. She passed away in 2007. [15]</p>
