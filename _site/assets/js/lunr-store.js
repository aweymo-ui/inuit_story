        "text": "Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth and I have worked with the University of Idaho Library as the Digital Initiatives Librarian in the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) department since the fall of 2023. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, collaborating on projects with fellowship recipients, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department. Experience I come from multi-disciplinary background, creating work about history using long form audio, video, animation and writing that compliments my current work in digital scholarship well. Before joining U of I, I worked as the Digital Media Editor for the Washington State focused digital encyclopedia, HistoryLink, where I helped add visual context to written material and ensured none of the material was copyright protected. Moving image I created manipulating elements of an archival photograph from the CCC Idaho collection as a part of the 2024 Poster Series Continuing Education Since moving from Tacoma to Moscow for this position, I have also become a student again, pursuing another master’s, this time in history here at U of I. While taking on this workload and working as an Assistant Professor has been a huge workload, it’s also helped me ground my work into creating practical applications for my digital scholarship work that can help students and researchers enhance their scholarship, such as this workflow I’ve developed on using Python tools to pull annotations from reading materials and visualize these elements in the note taking application Obsidian. Example of the graph output in Obsidian using the Python Annotation Extraction Tool mentioned above. The purple and blue nodes represent books for two different courses, the green nodes represent their tags and their proximity to one another represents their connections and contrasts. Digital Scholarship Example One example of a digital scholarship project I’ve worked on using a database that we will talk more about in a moment is using Web of Science to create Bibliometrics. This was prompted by my work creating a digital collection for the U of I’s Taylor Wilderness Research Station, a scientific refuge that students have been visiting in the remote Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness since the 1970s. Bibliometrics are the use of statistical methods to analyze books, articles and other publications. The concept for this project was to see if there was some way to visualize all of the academic work that was produced by students and faculty members after conducting research at the station to convey a sense of the institution’s “research impact” over time. &#10042; Arlow Lewis, the caretaker of Taylor Ranch for several years, far left with glasses. Kneeling on left is Jim Bennett, then a PhD student working on bighorn sheep. Carol Bennett is in the yellow top, courtesy U of I Special Collections (DSC_0360) Approach This led me to consider some questions: What does it mean for a paper to be the direct product of a specific place? Does a work need to mention Taylor by name? Are we only looking at research produced by U of I? How long after the author visits Taylor is it still considered a product of that place? With this in mind, I decided to zoom out a bit and look at authors from U of I who were simply present in the archive, rather than specific titles. &#10042; Network Visualization After creating an author name equation so I only needed to search for authors in seven batches of 100 names rather than a bleak 737 individual searches, this compiled Web of Science data was then exported in CSV format and then imported into VOSviewer, a Dutch, open-source network visualization platform with excellent documentation and an intuitive interface. Visualization of citation impact over time of authors that contributed to work found in the Taylor Wilderness Research Station digital archive. Node size indicates the number of times the work has been cited, color and distance indicates groups formed by subject and keyword likeness and lines connecting nodes indicates shared citations. I wanted to analyze: future citations of specific documents co-authorship of papers, and fields of interest over time. Once these three visualizations were completed, further customization was done adjusting node color to represent scientific discipline, size to represent the number of times the work has been cited, and arrangement according to when they were published. Selecting a node brings up a pane on the lower right hand corner of the screen which reveals more details on the title and, if available, creates a link to the research paper itself. These visualizations were then embedded into our CollectionBuilder site using the VOS-Viewer Online function. While these do take a short while to process the JSON data on loading, the bibliometrics add a colorful and interactive element that reduces a daunting amount of scholarly work into a single visualization. While you may be doing more straight-forward searching using Web of Science and similar scientific databases in your work, pulling more detailed data from these databases could possibly add an interesting visual element to your final projects!"

        "text": "In addition to the database resources we will be covering in just a moment, we also have a range of in-person resources available to you all as U of I students. Events Presentation Transcript and Slides for the 2024 U of I Information Landscape Series We host a variety of events at the library which may be helpful for you all in your development, such as the Information Landscapes annual series that is freely available for anyone to attend. This year, I contributed to this series with workshops on using geolocation tools and methods to identify archival images that lack location metadata and a workshop / resource on discovering copyright free media to enrich your presentations. Nearly all of our faculty creates workshops for this series and it covers a very diverse amount of material that may be of interest to your studies. Digital poster for the 25th anniversary of the Library's annual GIS Day We are also celebrating our 25th anniversary of GIS Day at the library, an event which brings together scholars, students, professionals, businesses, and the public to discuss geospatial technologies and demonstrate their many uses. I also created a presentation for this event on the different tools available now for creating aerial time lapse videos, something that could certainly help enrich scientific presentations. Digital poster for the author's 2024 Tech Talk We also curate a series in our DataHub called Tech Talks, which cover a range of technologically oriented material, ranging from creating your own static sites using GitHub, modelling data visualizations so they can be more easily understood by the public and creating text mining tools using Python to help understand vast amounts of text before taking a closer look at each part of the text individually. We also just started hosting the long running Renfrew Colloquium at the library in the first floor “living room” area that has a big success so far and hosted a wide variety of really interesting speakers that have ranged from “Climate-Smart” Agriculture and Marketing, to composing music for silent film and the architectural value of Idaho’s fire watch towers. Physical Spaces In addition to private study and conference rooms you are welcome to reserve for individual and group study, the library also maintains unique technical resources to help enrich your work. This includes The Studio, where you can use audio/visual production equipment to record, edit and digitize audio and video projects and even has equipment for green screen and an E-Glass recorder for creating presentations. A full list of resources can be found at this link in the presentation site. There is also the Making, Innovating and Learning Laboratory (or the MILL) that has 3D printers, vinyl cutters, sewing machines, VR headsets and a laser cutter available for reservation and regularly hold really fun, interactive events that are a great way to meet people on campus and learn new disciplines. U of I Library Reading Room with Special Collection Material. Photograph by Brian Tibayan We also maintain a large academic archive at the U of I library that can be a valuable resource for primary documents to help make your work stronger and add historic contrast. You can search the archive at a collection (not item) level through this Archives West portal and, if you find something of interest, contact our excellent archivists at libspec@uidaho.edu with the details, who can schedule you a time to review the materials in person at the first floor meeting room. Just this year, I have collaborated with Special Collections on two CALS-related, Gary Strong Fellowship recipient projects on the Plant, Soil, and Entomological Sciences Records and the WWAMI Scrapbook digital collections. Which leads me to my corner of the library, the CDIL. Every year, we work with undergraduate, graduate and faculty recipients of the CDIL and Berry Fellowships, and I would highly encourage you to apply this year if you are interested in building a site to help enrich your research and develop your technical skills!"

        "text": "Academic Search Premier Diving into the electronic databases we have available at the library, Academic Search Premier is a multi-disciplinary database that contains full-text versions of thousands of publications, including academic titles, popular magazines, and newspapers. Since it covers nearly all fields of study, it’s a good place to start a research project. Keywords Search You can access Academic Search Premier from the library’s homepage under the catalog search bar. Once you log in with your UI credentials, you can type your keyword search terms in the search box. For example, if your topic is Use of bST (growth hormone) to increase milk production, you can type bST in the search box and click the Search button. This search yields over 4,000 results. You may notice that most results are irrelevant to our topic. In addition to results that may be of interest, there are also results relating to behavior skills training and education that might not be relevant. To refine, you could spell out the abbreviation bST, “Bovine somatotropin”, putting quotes around it to search for this exact phrase. This search yields over 1,000 relevant results, including popular and scholarly sources. If you are only interested in popular sources for now, check the boxes for News and Magazines under Source Types on the left side of the screen. You may also change the Publication Date to limit the results to recent sources from the last few years. Note: When exploring non-peer reviewed material, you may encounter scientific material that is outdated or otherwise incorrect. If you want to investigate the validity of any item you are looking at, I would recommend using our CRAAP test (AKA currency, relevance, authority, accuracy and purpose) to evaluate the sources based on assessment criteria. Subjects Search You can also refine searches using subjects, which are tags that indexers have attached to documents depending on what an article is about or the theories or methodologies they followed to create it. These are helpful because common terms that we use to describe certain fields can later be attached to a document’s subject field, even if the title or text of that document does not. This brings earlier or international work into the same conversation as more contemporary or english language documents in the search results. Using the Subject Filter displayed above, you can refine your resources depending on your focus, whether that is nutrition, companies like Monsanto or organizations like the USDA. Experimenting with different combinations of subjects, keywords and boolean operators like implementing quotes for exact searches and “AND” “OR” operators will help you find the material you need faster."

        "text": "You can also find a variety of different types of sources, from popular to scholarly, in a variety of different formats in the U of I library catalog. In the search box, type in your keyword search terms. For instance, if your topic is Low-fat vs. whole milk consumption, you can use “Low-fat” AND “whole milk” AND consumption as your keyword search terms. You may consider adding other keywords, such as effect*, impact*, etc. Summit In the dropdown menu next to the magnifying glass icon in the search box, choose UI Library+E-Resources if you are only interested in resources that can be found in the U of I Library. Otherwise, choose UI+Summit+E-Resources to access resources in 37 academic libraries throughout Oregon, Washington and Idaho, keeping in mind that the delivery of these physical items from this network usually takes between a week and two weeks. Refine Results You will find many of the same filters to refine results in our catalog as we discussed in EBSCO Premier, including Full Text Online, if you only want materials you can read in it’s entirety remotely, Resource Type to view peer reviewed or non-peer reviewed material, a publication date slider to filter chronologically and Subject Filter which uses the Library of Congress Subject Heading schema, which you can learn more about here. Screen capture demonstration of how you navigate from an item level document in the library catalog to the periodical page and finally to the downloadable PDF. If you are looking for Full Text Online results, you may be sent to many of the different online periodicals that we subscribe to as a library. You will need to be logged in as a student and then look for View Online, where you will be sent to the online journal. Though presentation may vary depending on the site, look for the red and white PDF icon that should send you to the download page."

        "title": "Web of Science",
        "text": "Web of Science provides access to leading scholarly literature in the sciences, social sciences in addition to proceedings of international conferences, symposia and seminars that may be helpful in your pursuits. While you don’t need to create an account to search Web of Science, it can be a helpful way to retain searches, get recommendations based on those searches and create lists of documents that you can batch export, which is how I created the bibliometrics visualizations that I brought up earlier. Web of Science Search Interface I won’t go into many of the search features that are now familiar to you but just focus on where the platform stands out in it’s ability to not only search by keyword and subject, but really focus in on scholarly work produced by researchers, specific organizations, who they cited and who cited them. This is helpful for understanding the development of particular areas of scientific thought. In the example above looking at Taylor Wilderness Research Center natural science academic James Akenson, by locating their academic profile, we can see who they cited in their work, who cited them and the visualization of that data to form specific connections around their scholarship and their academic networks."

        "text": "Databases In addition to Academic Search Premier and Web of Science, here are a few more useful databases to find scholarly articles on dairy science: Agricola (Ebsco) Over 4.8 million citations to journal articles, monographs and theses CAB Direct Subjects covered include animal science, crop protection and plant science AGRIS AGRIS is an international cooperative system that provides citations to journal literature, theses and reports Journals The library subscribes to the following diary science journals, most of which are online, including: Animal Feed Science and Technology Animal Genetics Applied Animal Behaviour Science And many more! Print Books One viable search strategy to find print books on a topic is stack browsing. That is to visit the library and locate the physical bookshelves to browse the book collections with a particular subject focus area using LC call number. For example, if you are interested in Dairy processing and Dairy products, you would want to look for call numbers that start with SF250.5-275. Other relevant call numbers include: SF1-1100 Animal culture SF94.5-99 Feeds and feeding. Animal nutrition SF191-275 Cattle SF221-250 Dairying QP1-(981) Physiology QP501-801 Animal biochemistry Use the floor maps to locate the shelves that contain the specified call number groups. Government Documents When searching the library catalog, you can filter the results by Government Documents under Resource Type. These documents are located on the library basement. You can click this link or email Rami Attebury to learn more about how to access government documents. You can use Google to search for government documents as well. Add site:gov at the end of your keyword search terms will yield results from government webpages. For instance, if your topic is on Contribution of dairy industry to greenhouse gases, you can search for dairy AND “greenhouse gas” site:gov. Data and Statistics If you are looking for contextual background information and overview of issue at stake for your presentation, consider incorporating some data and statistics on production, consumption, price, or standards of dairy products: USDA dairy market news Milk marketing order statistics USDA economic research service dairy data USDA dairy products grades and standards US dairy export council dairy data dashboard USDA dairy products monthly production data USDA census of agriculture USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Citation Remember to cite your sources and format them according to the reference style of either Journal of Animal Science or Journal of Dairy Science. You may also consider using a citation manager (if you have never used one before) to cite your sources. A citation manager can be a time saver, and is incredibly useful if you are thinking about pursuing a master’s or doctoral degree in which considerable writing is expected. Check out the recording of library workshop on Citation Management with Zotero below if interested. Citation Management with Zotero Finally.
